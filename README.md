# Sunspot

## sunspot_solr

It's a fork version from [sunspot/sunspot](https://github.com/sunspot/sunspot). I upgraded the solr instance from 3.5 to 4.3.1 in order to integrate with [MMSeg4j](https://github.com/chenlb/mmseg4j-solr) (1.9.1). You can find documents for usage and installation from [sunspot/sunspot](https://github.com/sunspot/sunspot) page.
